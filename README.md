## Required Libraries and Versions
These versions have been validated for compatibility and stable performance.
If you wish to install them manually, execute:

pip install python-docx==1.1.2 pandas==2.1.1 openpyxl==3.1.5 numpy==2.1.3

## Input Preparation
Before running the script, users must prepare a folder named word/ inside the project root directory.
This folder should contain all relevant Word documents, each describing plasmid distribution or cloning information.
Example layout:
word/
├── NP476_Distribution.docx
├── NP477_Distribution.docx
├── NP478_Distribution.docx

## Usage Instructions

Once all dependencies are installed and input files are placed in the word/ directory, execute the main program from a terminal or command prompt:

python main.py

This will trigger the following automated steps:
Scan the word/ directory for all .docx files.
Extract structured plasmid distribution data.
Aggregate results into a standardized output file (e.g., .csv or .xlsx).
An optional report summarization script can also be executed after the main parsing step:

python report_2.py

This script integrates processed data into a comprehensive report suitable for experimental documentation or submission.

## Expected Output

Parsed plasmid distribution tables (CSV or Excel format).
Optional summary report generated by report_2.py.
All outputs are saved in the project’s root directory unless otherwise specified

## Version Information
